# Motivation and Problem
  - Agriculture has been a crucial sector of the Egyptian economy for thousands of years, and it remains an essential part of the country's economic and social fabric today. Here are some of the key reasons why agriculture is important in Egypt:
       1.	Food security: Egypt's population is large and growing, and agriculture is critical to ensuring that the country can feed its people. The sector provides a significant portion of the country's food supply, including staples such as wheat, rice, and maize.
       2.	Employment: Agriculture is a significant source of employment in Egypt, particularly in rural areas. The sector provides jobs for millions of people, including farmers, farm laborers, and workers in related industries such as food processing and transportation.
       3.	Economy: Agriculture is a significant component of the Egyptian economy, contributing 11.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The agricultural sector accounts for 28 percent of all jobs, and over 55 percent of employment in Upper Egypt is agriculture-related according to USAID.
       4.	Export earnings: Egypt is a significant exporter of agricultural products, including fruits, vegetables, and cotton. These exports generate important foreign exchange earnings for the country, helping to support its economy.
